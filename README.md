# ERA5-Land hourly data from 1950 to present
This python script utilizes Selenium as well as Pyautogui, to automate the download process of data from this website: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form

## Getting Started
Simply download the python file, and make these modifications:
- add in your file paths, in the changeable data section
- change the Pyautogui move functions to the correct spot for your screen, as different screen sizes will have different coordinates for the cursor
